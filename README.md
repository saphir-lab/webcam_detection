# Goal
Use the **opencv-python** (cv2) module in order to analyze video from a webcam.

Final goal is to design a green square around object appearing on screen after the first image captured when starting camera.

>**Note**: *For educational purpose, multiple video screens are diplayed in order to explain the logic followed and all image transformations applied before being able to desgin green square(s) on the image*

# Usage
1. Use a laptop having built-in webcam.
2. Start program without being in front of webcam.
3. Once you see videos on your screen, move in front of the webcam.
4. You should see multiple real time video with one of them containing green square around you  (and following you when moving on screen).
>**Note**: *In order to quit the program, you need to press letter "q" on your keyboard (the standard 'system button' to close windows will not work)*
